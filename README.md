# discretization_-binning:
Binning involves grouping continuous data into discrete intervals, aiding in feature engineering. Techniques like Quantile Binning divide data based on quantiles, while KMeans Binning uses clustering. Binarization transforms numerical values into binary format, simplifying data representation. These methods contribute to efficient data handling and analysis.
